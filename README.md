# momentum
This project is a kind of Google Ð¡hrome extension called momentum.
The following functionality is implemented here:
1. A player with a fixed number of songs;
2. A simple ToDo List (without setting to localStorage);
3. Watch with greeting;
4. Weather widget (data from a API);
5. Async background slider;
6. Quotes widget;
7. Translation by button;
There are some bugs (changing background when russian language is selected, size of todo list when added a lot of things)
